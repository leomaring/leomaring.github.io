title: How to Improve Your English Pronunciation without much effort
categories: English
---
We know when learning English, pronunciation is very important. I myself also pronounce very poorly, because the work of a coder makes me read more than say. I also tried some methods, learned a pronunciation course on the internet ... The big part of them taught us how to learn each syllable (single and double). At first I was quite proud, however, this method really needed great effort, while I was lazy. After a few days, I started getting bored and completely left after a week.<!--more-->

Today I discovered a method to learn English pronunciation is very good without much effort. This method I learn from Youtube channel of Web5ngay, you can go there to see. Here I will summarize the main content.

First, we need to clarify our goal of learning to pronounce. Have you heard Harri Won speak Vietnamese yet? Does she say that she is completely Vietnamese? Yes, she is not exactly Vietnamese, but we all understand, even praising her for being so good at Vietnamese. For me, learning to speak simply is to say English to foreigners. I do not have the desire to be an MC or a singer. So, I just say the correct sound, correct the intonation so that others understand is okay, not need or like foreigners
